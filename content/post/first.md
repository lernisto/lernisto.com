As I was following John Sonmez's course [*10 Steps to Learn Anything Quickly*](http://bit.ly/29pbVTp), I decided to document my learning of HTML5. I started by creating a blog to record my progress.  In creating the blog, I realized that I have been sitting on a brand just as strong as John's *Simple Programmer*, and that the domain name was available. (Amazing, I know.) Thus is born [lernisto.com](https://lernisto.com/).  

Ok, maybe the competition for "lernisto" as a search keyword is not strong. The top two results are posts involving my Github account. You only learn the meaning of the word in the third SERP. But, hey, it is unique, short, memorable, and makes Esperanto speakers feel special. ;-)

*Lernisto*, in case you don't know Esperanto, consists of the root *lerni*, meaning "to learn", combined with the suffix *-isto*, meaning one who does something professionally or extremely well. (Think: cell<i>ist</i>, violin<i>ist</i>.)  One naive translation to English of "professional schoolchild" might have negative connotations, but "professional learner" is perfect. The schoolchild, however, does have at least two advantages over most adults: humility, and curiosity. I don't believe there is anything wrong or embarrassing about not knowing something. The only shame is from being too proud or lazy to learn it.

My personal motto is *Ä‰iam lernanta*, which means "always learning".
