Ok, there are several projects that I would like to build:

  1. pop toaster (for email on shumway.us: prerequisite for all networking)
  2. blog toaster ([as mentioned yesterday](../static-blog-in-7-minutes/))
  3. social toaster

I also need to know how to run data analysis jobs on a compute cluster.

All of this requires that I be able to create and deploy machine images efficiently.
