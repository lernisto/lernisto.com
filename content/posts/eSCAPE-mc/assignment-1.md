2. Were you surprised by any of your scores? If so, why?

My weak areas are: No More Tomorrow; Ask Questions, Seek Answers; and Quitting.

I have committed to get this blog going today. No more putting it off until tomorrow as I have done hundreds of times. My first *serious* attempt at blogging was in July 2016. It lasted about a month. Sad. But that will never happen again.

I find it difficult to trust others. I have to do everything -- figure out everything -- myself. Today during the millionaire access, I asked a question. I had my own ideas of an answer that would satisfy me, but I asked anyway. I did not like your answer, but I will follow it. Tomorrow I will do a video critique of code posted as a question on Stack Overflow. I understand that it is rude and foolish to ask for advice and not follow it.

Quitting? Ha! I laugh at failure. This one surprised me. I don't see myself as a quitter. Upon analyzing my past behavior, however, I found that the shoe fits. I am suceptible to what my daughter calls ADOS (Attention Deficit Oooh Shiny!) Yes, the number of courses I have not finished is large. Had I persisted in the smallest fraction of them, I would be far better off today. I hereby adopt these two persistance inducing mantras: "Not dead: can't quit" from Richard "Mack" Machowicz, and "It's not over until I win" from Les Brown.

3. Do you want to pursue being an Intrapreneur or an Entrepreneur? Why?

Settling for intraprenuership at this point would feel too much like quitting. It might appease my wife, but just now I think she is getting used to the idea that I will never be satisfied with a job. I have been a struggling entrepreneur, or a "technician having an entrepreneurial seizure" for two decades. In recent months I have made important breakthroughs that I believe will finally make a difference:

 1) I understand that mindset is at least as important as skills.
 2) I understand that I cannot do this alone. I need to seek out and follow trustworthy mentors. I must proactively expand my network.
 3) I understand that because time is limited, I must do only what only I can do.
