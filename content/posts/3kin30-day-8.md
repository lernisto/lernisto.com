Today is Education Tuesday: time to sharpen the saw.

I worked more on the Netlify domain issue.

I attended Jonathan Green's SNM Author SHIP webinar. My story as I wrote it before now seems extra weak. I am learning the importance of listening to and getting help from people who have already done what you want to do. One class changed the way I think about storytelling.

I attended one of Anik Singal's eSCAPE bootcamp webinars and signed up for the masterclass. Watching Anik expertly teach and engage the participants was well worth the price of admission. Later, I watched two webinar replays in which he followed the same pattern. He is a master teacher and a master of selling without selling.

Les Brown was a guest at the beginning of the webinar. His story is inspiring. If he can do it, I can do it. "It's not over until I win." I can relate to his account of sleeping in his office and bathing in the bathroom sinks. [Listen to Les Brown in the Georgia Dome](https://youtu.be/KlUMrzwmbyo). "Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality."

I listened to a Tony Robbins talk: [Stay HUNGRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiVkYo7ci7g). "There is never a lack of resources, only a lack of resourcefulness." I had thought, there is no way I can join Anik's masterclass. I discovered that was not true. If you have enough HUNGER, you will find a way. I did find a way. I feel a change in myself and my thinking. I actually *dreamed* about selling digital products. We all have a story about why we are where we are. You change your life by changing your story. If you are going to be successful, you have to stop blaming others and take responsibility.

"What will make you stay up all night to build your business?" I think I went to bed at about 2am. But when I woke up four hours later, I was still full of energy and ready to go back to work.
