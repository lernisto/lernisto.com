Day 6 was Sunday so I rested.

Todo:

* practice deploying websites with at least three more sites.
* document the process and share it for the benefit of others.
* build a landing page with a working email opt-in.
* document the process for others.
* figure out how to hide things behind a paywall. Netlify's solution for this problem is prohibitively expensive for startups, so it will probably involve hosting somewhere else.
* figure out commenting. Disqus works, but is far from ideal.

Done:

I did a lot of practicing. I learned that I am quite out of practice but it is coming back to me. I am going to have to spend some real time learning HTML and modern web design. I can understand why people hire others to do this.
