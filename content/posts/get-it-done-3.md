Ok, that last post was cheating. But this one is real.

On September 12, Edward Muir posted in a mastermind group:

> You earn $3000 per month at your 9-5, which comfortably supports your family. Out of the blue, you're fired.

> What do you do?
> Where do you go to make money fast in our line of work?

> Purely hypothetical.

I replied:

> Not at all hypothetical:

> Yesterday at 2:00 pm I received a call from my former employer telling me "The doctor found something in your physical that concerns us. We don't want you to get injured. Don't come into work until we can arrange for you to work somewhere safe." Within three hours I have my work email account deleted and receive a phone call from a competing temp agency offering me an equally unsuitable job. I am definitely unemployed.

> My wife is frantic. I had known this would happen, just based on how I felt after work. To me, it is a relief to never go back. But, yes, "We have a problem, Houston."

> What to do? Think like a rich person. Goal $3000 in 30 days. Laser focus. No excuses. Execution is the only thing that matters.

> Thirty days is too short a time frame for getting paid from a Kindle book, so I will build a course instead. Feedback from the pilot course will help me 1) build the full course, 2) write the book that will act as a lead generator for the course, 3) help me identify and gather an audience for future products and courses. Tuition paid by the students of the pilot course will meet my $3000 goal: 15 students @ $200 each.

> day 1 (yesterday): set up a website, like you have been "planning" for months.

> day 2:

> 1. set up an autoresponder and opt-in page to start gathering an audience.
> 2. scour appropriate places on the web to look for "problem language" What does the audience need to learn enough that they are willing to pay $200 to listen to me tell them?
> 3. use this language to craft a compelling offer for the landing/opt-in page.
> 4. reach out to my network to see what I can do to get targeted traffic.

> day 3: worry about that tomorrow

> * by day 10, I will have a rough syllabus for the pilot course.

> * by day 20, I will have started selling the course

> * day 28: launch.

Ok. I can see that I was being quite optimitistic. This is what actually 
happened so far:

## Day 1

I did set up a web site [TerrelShumway.com](https://www.terrelshumway.com).
It is nothing exciting, but I did follow the entire flow from registering
a domain name to deploying the site with TLS. I recorded the hole process
with CamStudio. It took about an hour. Unfortunately CamStudio crashed
at some point, so the video was lost. 

I got stopped by a problem with the theme I wanted to use not supporting
the version of Hugo I was using, so I just called it a day with an ugly
hand-edited HTML page.

## Day 2

I was going to be brilliant and do a week's work in a day...

I spent too much time on Facebook.

## Day 3

I was going to do the previous day's list. Really do it.

I fiddled with Hugo a bit. Then I researched 7 different autoresponder
service providers. Still nothing to show for my efforts.

In response to a post by Jonathan Green on procrastination I wrote:

> My "One Thing" right now is to create a new blog website. I'll be back in 60 minutes.

Jonathan replied:

> I can't wait to see it

Yeah, well I can't wait to see it either.

## Day 4

I announced to everyone "Today is Blog Post Friday. I will post to my blog
today."

Ten minutes later, I had fulfilled my promise (cheating a lot, by copying 
and editing the only other post I had made -- 5 months earlier).

Then I spend a very productive day, again going through every step of 
creating and deploying a blog website, this time for my daughter [JoyLynn](https://joylynn.shumway.us/).
It has a long way to go, but I did figure out every step that would need
to be followed by someone who just connected to the internet for the first time.
It was a lot of work. It is easy to forget how much I have learned over
the years that is *not* intuitive to a newbie.

Finally, I am about to give the command that *might* deploy this staging 
site to a real server. <strike>If you can read this, it worked.</strike>

Ok. It didn't work. I'll work on it tomorrow.
