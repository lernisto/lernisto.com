* Sacrifice
* Self Development
  "I want to challenge your decision making."
  "I read about 30 books per year. I have never made it to my goal of 50"
  "I run six companies that generate >$30 million. I spent $250,000 in self development last year. I didn't get where I am by asking people for free stuff."
* Eating an Elephant
  You can't get anything without doing something.
* Calculated risk taking
  Don't be stupid. Do the math.

Row row row row your boat
gently down the stream
merily merily merily merily
life is but a dream

3 Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
4 Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
5 Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
(Psalms 37:3â€“5)
