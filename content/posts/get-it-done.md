Do you need to get something done? Something you have been procrastinating 
for a long time? Here is how to do it.

<dl>
<dt>Choose a deadline.</dt>
<dd>In my case I chose today.</dd>
<dt>Choose a punishment.</dt>
<dd>This should be something you <i>really</i> don't want to do. 
The person I heard this from promised to give $1000 to his least 
favorite cousin. 
I offered my daughter fifty dollars, if I did not meet the 
deadline for posting to my blog.
</dd>
<dt>Tell everyone about it.</dt>
<dd>You must make the punishment real and enforceable.</dd>
<dt>Voila</dt>
<dd>If you did all of the above correctly, selecting a reasonable
deadline and a horrible punishment, you <i>will</i> find a way
to accomplish your task.
</dd>

I love you, JoyLynn, but your payday is not this week. Thank you 
for keeping me accountable.
