That didn't work, apparently because some change in the theme is not compatible with the new Hugo version. I fixed it and deployed to [a different location](https://confident-clarke-3a33ca.netlify.com/). Now I am waiting on support to 
recover the account I used to deploy at the old domain.

Netlify makes it really easy to create new accounts. Resist the urge to do so.
I am learning that it is better to have all of your sites under one account, unless, for example, they are for different clients.

## Email Service

I finally found an email solution I can live with for a long time:
[FastMail.fm](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=19980352) (This affiliate link gives you 10% off your first year.)

I highly recommend the "standard" plan because you can use your own domain(s):

  1. It is more professional.
  2. You can move it somewhere else if you want to (I don't see any reason to do so).
  3. It is more flexible: you can create aliases and forward them anywhere.

Now I can get all of my email consolidated into one place.
