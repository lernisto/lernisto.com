I took Anik Singal's [eSCORE quiz](https://escapebook.com/quiz). I came out weak in three areas:

## No More Tomorrow

> Entrepreneurs understand that there’s no better time to chase their dreams than the present moment.
>
> Your score indicates that you’re hesitant to embrace the present moment. We strongly encourage you to read Chapter 18: No More Tomorrow in eSCAPE.

## Ask Questions, Seek Answers

> Entrepreneurs know how to ask the right questions to find the information that they need.
>
> Your score indicates that you’re uncomfortable with asking questions and seeking out information. We strongly encourage you to read Chapter 30: Ask Questions, Seek Answers in eSCAPE.

## Quitting
> Successful Entrepreneurs persevere through the toughest times because they are confident in their ideas and abilities.
>
> Your score indicates that you may have a problematic relationship with failure. We strongly encourage you to read Chapter 12: Quitting in eSCAPE.
