## Why do I want to learn Atom?

Atom is an editor based on webtech and Chromium (electron.io spin off).  The editor is a professional programmer's "hammer" -- the essential tool that is used more than anything else. Investing time to learn to use an editor efficiently will yield great returns.  Atom is free (as in speech: $70 for Sublime Text is a pretty small investment, but it is not nearly as hackable as Atom) and modern (as poor a language as JavaScript is, vimscript is worse.)

Of course there is always Emacs: Lisp is better than JavaScript. Emacs is the quintessential Free Software. Mature? um. YES. Resource usage? It is hard to be heavier than a modern web browser.

[Why use Emacs over Sublime Text](https://www.quora.com/Why-use-Emacs-over-Sublime-Text) (I see SublimeText and Atom as direct competitors. Sublime has Python, but is not Free. Atom is Free, but uses <strike>Javascript</strike>coffeescript.)

Conclusion: I am going to try Emacs.

Nevermind: consider [this](http://walkah.net/blog/between-atom-and-emacs/) and [this](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/github-atoms-code-editor-nerds-take-universe/)
and [this](https://nuclide.io/). (I know: *shiny*).

"The reason why I eventually ended up in the Emacs world is that as a programmer I think the editor is the most intimate piece of software you work with. The editor is your tool. The editor is to the programmer what the brush is to the painter, the scalpel to the sculptor, the sword to the swordsman, â€¦ you get it."

Drawbacks: slow startup.

Conclusion: yes, I will try atom. I think there are good things in both worlds.

  [Bad APIs](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.in/2007/05/amazingly-bad-apis.html) notes that  "If you are building a platform, you should also be writing applications for that platform, and the platform should be designed to make life very simple for those apps."  IOW: eat your own dogfood. Build something that works.
