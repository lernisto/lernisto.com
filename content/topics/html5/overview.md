## Why am I learning HTML5?

I wanted to set up a blog, and did not want to use Wordpress. Yes, I know Wordpress is easy.
However:

 1. I am a bigot about PHP (It is worse than Javascript, if that is possible.)
 2. Wordpress has a poor record when it comes to resistance to hacking.
 3. I prefer static sites. Doing the same thing over and over again seems wasteful, even if computers are particularly well suited to the task.

I also recognize that HTML/Javascript/CSS are the *lingua franca* of the web, and knowing how to speak the language cannot hurt.  I have put off learning Javascript *well* for a long time, and decided I should just bite the bullet.

The "new" parts of HTML5 include `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<canvas>`. These would be good places to focus initial efforts.

## What is there to learn?

A lot:

  1. basic static coding
  2. styling with CSS
  3. cross-browser compatibility (coding and testing)
  4. progressive enhancement with Javascript
  5. accessibility (adds a lot of complexity to the cross-browser problem, because the "accessible" user agents are so different from the "normal" ones.)
  6. user experience design
  7. information architecture
  8. server-side applications
  9. server-less applications (offline first, static peer-to-peer)
  10. credential management (passwords, roles, and all of that)
  11. backend programming (application servers, data stores)
  12. cloud platforms (AWS, Google, Heroku, OpenStack, ...)
  13. information assurance (security, encryption, PKI, etc.)
  14. network architecture

I suppose I shouldn't call it "HTML5" when I really mean "webtech". Strictly speaking, HTML5 only encompasses the first 5 items on this list, but a developer cannot really say he knows the web unless he understands at least the basics of all of these.


## What projects are appropriate to start with?

 * Hugo blog
 * video gallery and playlist: static site with client-side javascript enhancements

## What resources are available?

  * edx courses presented by W3C
  * too many to enumerate
