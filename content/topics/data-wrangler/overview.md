## What is Data Wrangling?

I am going to call it a sub-discipline of Data Science.

There is a lot of attention given to "Big Data" and the questions you can answer through analysis. But the buzzwords ignore many sticky real-world problems that surround the acquisition and management of all of that data.  The analysis is more academic, while "wrangling" is closer to the devops domain: Where do you keep it? How do you get it where it needs to be? How do you keep it secure from eyes that shouldn't see it?

I found a job posting that seems to match quite closely my idea of this field:
