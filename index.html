        <p>Do you need to get something done? Something you have been procrastinating 
          for a long time? Here is how to do it.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Choose a deadline.</dt>
            <dd>In my case I chose today.</dd>
          <dt>Choose a punishment.</dt>
          <dd>This should be something you <i>really</i> don't want to do. 
            The person I heard this from promised to give $1000 to his least 
            favorite cousin. 
            I offered my daughter fifty dollars, if I did not meet the 
            deadline for posting to my blog.
          </dd>
          <dt>Tell everyone about it.</dt>
          <dd>You must make the punishment real and enforceable.</dd>
          <dt>Voila</dt>
          <dd>If you did all of the above correctly, selecting a reasonable
            deadline and a horrible punishment, you <i>will</i> find a way
            to accomplish your task.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>I love you, JoyLynn, but your payday is not this week. Thank you 
          for keeping me accountable.

            My daughter said I have to eat a guava if I did not meet the 
            deadline for posting to my blog.

        <p>I love you, JoyLynn. Thank you for threatening me with what I consider to be the second most revolting fruit I have ever eaten.
